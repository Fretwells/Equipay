# Equipay

Discussing compensation is all too often a strict taboo, and many can't see what lies past the perceived faux pas. When done right, salary transparency allows for greater employee leverage in negotiating pay, especially for vulnerable demographic groups. Equipay, through clear-cut display of anonymous salary data, provides our users with that very leverage. Keep in mind, however, that the dataset utilized does not necessarily reflect real trends in compensation at the given companies. The dataset was fabricated, and is therefore for demonstration purposes only. Explore the most recent Equipay build [here](https://equipay-bd74d.web.app/) \(Deployed June 9th, 2021).
